.TH XTITLE 1 "21 September 2024" BSD 2.1
.SH NAME
xtitle - change title bar and icon text for a xterm compatible window
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xtitle
text ... 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIXtitle\fP prints on standard out its arguments of 
.I text 
strings wrapped in an escape sequence to change both the window
and icon title. The program code is deliberately simplistic to 
build under vintage BSD systems.
.sp
.B xtitle 
performs one edit to the text as the program echoes it: it replaces
the first reference to the user's home directory in each argument
with the literal ~.
.PP
For example, the following alias when set in tcsh as a pre-prompt
command will update window title to the specified information before
every tcsh command prompt:
.sp
	alias   precmd  xtitle ${user}@`hostname`:${tty} '${cwd}'
.sp
Note that as specified, the first (unquoted) argument is immediately
evaluated by the shell when the alias is set; only the quoted
current directory is resolved every time the command runs.
.SH FILES
.br
~/.cshrc	user's alias for the command.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
tcsh(1)

.SH BUGS
The program is a simplistic translation to C of a years-old shell
script which sadly is not supported on vintage BSD systems.
.sp
The terminal types supported (vt10*, vt220, xterm*, and screen*)
are hardcoded in the program.
.sp
That both the icon and title are updated is hardcoded in the program.
.sp
Shells which do not provide the ability to run a command before
every prompt require an alias for the
.B cd
command, or even harder contortions if no alias facility exists in
the user's preferred shell.
